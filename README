This sample (and fun) application shows in few steps how to use UIImageView for animation, UIButton for calling methods programatically,
AVAudioPlayer to play a sound in loop, FontLabel from Zynga to display custom Fonts and how to use NSTimer for a basic counter.

This wouldn't be possible without the resources of (In no particular order):
Zynga for their amazing FontLabel
Nyan.cat for the looped sound.
